* 6/23: Android studio has warmed up to the annotation processor
* 6/23: Preferences are injected now, but only on opening/closing of 'TweaksFragment', need to fix.

        updated as they change.

* 6/27: Tweakable integers are a thing now 
* 6/29: API Change - default values are the values of the field at runtime
